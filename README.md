# File-Uploader project 1
 In this application, I created a server to handle various functionalities including , file uploads, video
 uploads, image uploads, image size reduction, and local files(which stores on the current directory).
 The uploaded files are stored on Cloudinary (image and video management service) as well as in DB.
 Additionally, the application sends an email to the user who uploaded the file, containing a link to access
 the uploaded file - Express.js , Node.js , MongoDB , Postman , Cloudinary
